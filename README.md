# N-Mappy - A Nmap Command Learning Tool

======================================

## Description

N-Mappy is an interactive learning tool designed to help users learn and remember Nmap commands and their syntax. In N-Mappy, users form Nmap commands by dragging and dropping parts of commands in the correct order. The game provides immediate feedback, giving users a chance to learn from their mistakes and reinforcing their memory when they get commands right. For each command, the game also provides an explanation of what each part does, so users aren't just memorizing sequences of symbols but also learning how those commands work.
